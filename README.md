## 🧠 What is BrokeAF?

**BrokeAndFocused (BrokeAF)** is an open-source, AI-powered personal finance app, as most students don’t have time to micromanage every rupee. You’re juggling classes, side-hustles, rent, and maybe surviving on Maggi. That’s where BrokeAF steps in.

## 🎯 Why This Matters

Most students:
- Never learn budgeting until it’s too late
- Struggle with managing random income (stipends, allowances, gigs)
- Overspend on food, subscriptions, and impulse buys
- Hate budgeting apps that are complex, paid, or spammy

### 📌 BrokeAF is different:
- 🧠 **AI that learns your spending habits**
- 📊 **Graphs & visual insights** that speak your language
- 📨 **Weekly digests** that *feel like talking to a chill finance buddy*
- 🔐 **Privacy-first** — no trackers, no ads, no data mining
- 📴 **Offline-first** — works even without internet
